# How To Get Help

If it's a question, you should double-check the [FAQ](https://intercom.help/iexcloud/en/collections/1299541-faqs), which has answers to questions on costs, paperwork, redistribution, etc. The [Developer Docs](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) includes most everything else, but some questions won't be answerable via those documents. To receive the fastest response from IEX Cloud, please reach out to IEX Cloud's Support team directly at support@iexcloud.io. 

# More Data?

This is one of the most common types of request, so check [open issues](https://github.com/iexg/IEX-API/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Roadmap%3A+investigating+data+sources%22) to see if someone else has already asked for the same thing. If so, just click the "thumbs up" icon on the first comment (no need to write a comment).

# General Programming

For general programming questions, we recommend heading over to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [Super User](https://superuser.com). Questions like "how do I make your API go in C#" are more likely to get help on Stack Overflow, and phrased as "how do I make a REST API/sockets.io service work in C#" on Stack Overflow.

# Everything Else

For any other questions or issues, check our [full open issues list](https://github.com/iexg/IEX-API/issues), and see if someone else has asked the same question, or reported the same issue you're seeing, and click the "thumbs up" icon on the first comment if they have. If not, go ahead and [create a new issue](https://github.com/iexg/IEX-API/issues/new).
